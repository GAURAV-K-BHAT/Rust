This Is First Rust Project 

This Project is created for practice and it is available on official rust Book on the website 
In this Project we are generating a random number between 1 to 100
For that we have used external library named rand  from the official comunity of rust 
so after generating random number we are string it in integer 
and taking user input to guess the random number we are taking the input as string and after getting
the input we have used trim function to remove empty spaces and new lines . and after that we are storing 
that string after converting in integer into integer element
